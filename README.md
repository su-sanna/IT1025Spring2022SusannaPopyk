To be completed in the last module of the semester.

### Information System Components
-Hardware: PCs and/or phones are used by Amazon to make products accessible for purchase to clients. On the consumer side, PCs and/or phones are used to access the Amazon site and its products.
-Software: With the application software, Amazon is able to create its app and website where it can  upload files that hold information on their products; display their goods and services. On the consumer side, it allows customers to purchase goods.
-Data: Amazon can formulate analyses from data of purchases, wish lists, etc., to enhance their software, improve in various areas from products to customer services. 
-People: People is what keeps Amazon standing and succeeding. Without consumers, clients, and customers, Amazon would not be where it is today. The people invest in Amazon, purchase daily goods from it, and influence its advertisements. Not only do people benefit Amazon, but Amazon benefits the people too by providing them with jobs. And versatile jobs at that- from warehouse to delivery and beyond. 
-Process: Amazon is successful because their goal, I would say, is customer satisfaction. They make sure order details are correct, send various confirming emails, send out package tracking, and try their hardest to deliver quickly and efficiently. Thus, this whole process of purchasing from Amazon to retrieving the goods is to be done meticulously for the customer satisfaction. 

### Software
#### GitHub
Hadn’t had a full lot experience with Github, but overall, I like it and it looks straightforward. Github’s cloud computing is organized, easily understandable, and accessible. Github is very useful and fair in regards to the client-server. It is simple and broken down for the client to understand and be able to work at his own pace. Github gives a lot of resources, tools, and helps for all kinds of projects and for various instances. It also allows multiple people with various levels of knowledge and different backgrounds to be able to explore their site.

#### Screen Capture
The file I uploaded to GitHub is named, "ScreenCapture." It was created through the snipping tool found in Windows Operating System distributed by Microsoft. The type of file it is, is a PNG. It opens with "photos." Has the size of 68.8 KB or 70.538 bytes.
#### Application, Utility, and Operating Systems
-Application Software is used for working with specific tasks and completing certain functions. Some examples of an application are the calculator (for computing math), play store (for downloading content), Google (to search content), and many more like so. 
-Utility Software is an aide with different programs to help change or redirect a computer. An example of utility software would be McAfee or ESET. These are programs that make changes to a computer to shield it from viruses and all kinds of other gunk that may invade one’s pc.
-Operating system software is the parent of almost all programs. It is the initial program that gets inputted into a pc, which holds and controls many other different sub-programs and applications, as well as, control major functions and files. Some examples include Windows Operating systems, Apple Mac OS, Android, etc. 

#### ERP
Mainly used for various sized business- from big corps to small businesses (nowadays). It is a tool that combines different files and data from various users into one compiled database. This is extremely helpful for organizations with their accounting matters- helps to keep and bring all profits made into one system. Example of an ERP would be SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft. 
#### Virtualization
The purpose of virtualization is to share the capabilities of a hard drive among servers. A common IT problem solved by virtualization is breaking up a server into smaller parts that control a function and better in handling tasks. Following this, hypervisor in virtualization is a distinguishment of resources between physical and virtual environments. 
#### Python
-Simple but impactful. Manages the memory by itself. A high-level language. Portable to diverse platforms. 
-Interpreted language: instructions are outputted directly. 
-Compiled language: instruction is taken into machine code, then the processor executes. 
-Python1
-Python2
#### Graphic Modeling and Rendering
#### File Compression
#### Artificial Intelligence
