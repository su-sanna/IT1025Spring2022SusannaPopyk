### Information System Components
-Hardware: PCs and/or phones are used by Amazon to make products accessible for purchase to clients. On the consumer side, PCs and/or phones are used to access the Amazon site and its products.
-Software: With the application software, Amazon is able to create its app and website where it can  upload files that hold information on their products; display their goods and services. On the consumer side, it allows customers to purchase goods.
-Data: Amazon can formulate analyses from data of purchases, wish lists, etc., to enhance their software, improve in various areas from products to customer services. 
-People: People is what keeps Amazon standing and succeeding. Without consumers, clients, and customers, Amazon would not be where it is today. The people invest in Amazon, purchase daily goods from it, and influence its advertisements. Not only do people benefit Amazon, but Amazon benefits the people too by providing them with jobs. And versatile jobs at that- from warehouse to delivery and beyond. 
-Process: Amazon is successful because their goal, I would say, is customer satisfaction. They make sure order details are correct, send various confirming emails, send out package tracking, and try their hardest to deliver quickly and efficiently. Thus, this whole process of purchasing from Amazon to retrieving the goods is to be done meticulously for the customer satisfaction. 

### Software
#### GitHub
Hadn’t had a full lot experience with Github, but overall, I like it and it looks straightforward. Github’s cloud computing is organized, easily understandable, and accessible. Github is very useful and fair in regards to the client-server. It is simple and broken down for the client to understand and be able to work at his own pace. Github gives a lot of resources, tools, and helps for all kinds of projects and for various instances. It also allows multiple people with various levels of knowledge and different backgrounds to be able to explore their site.
