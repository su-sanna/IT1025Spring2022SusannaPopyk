## Executive Summary
To be completed in the last module of the semester.

### Information System Components
-Hardware: PCs and/or phones are used by Amazon to make products accessible for purchase to clients. On the consumer side, PCs and/or phones are used to access the Amazon site and its products.
-Software: With the application software, Amazon is able to create its app and website where it can  upload files that hold information on their products; display their goods and services. On the consumer side, it allows customers to purchase goods.
-Data: Amazon can formulate analyses from data of purchases, wish lists, etc., to enhance their software, improve in various areas from products to customer services. 
-People: People is what keeps Amazon standing and succeeding. Without consumers, clients, and customers, Amazon would not be where it is today. The people invest in Amazon, purchase daily goods from it, and influence its advertisements. Not only do people benefit Amazon, but Amazon benefits the people too by providing them with jobs. And versatile jobs at that- from warehouse to delivery and beyond. 
-Process: Amazon is successful because their goal, I would say, is customer satisfaction. They make sure order details are correct, send various confirming emails, send out package tracking, and try their hardest to deliver quickly and efficiently. Thus, this whole process of purchasing from Amazon to retrieving the goods is to be done meticulously for the customer satisfaction. 

### Software
#### GitHub
Hadn’t had a full lot experience with Github, but overall, I like it and it looks straightforward. Github’s cloud computing is organized, easily understandable, and accessible. Github is very useful and fair in regards to the client-server. It is simple and broken down for the client to understand and be able to work at his own pace. Github gives a lot of resources, tools, and helps for all kinds of projects and for various instances. It also allows multiple people with various levels of knowledge and different backgrounds to be able to explore their site.

#### Screen Capture
The file I uploaded to GitHub is named, "ScreenCapture." It was created through the snipping tool found in Windows Operating System distributed by Microsoft. The type of file it is, is a PNG. It opens with "photos." Has the size of 68.8 KB or 70.538 bytes.
#### Application, Utility, and Operating Systems
-Application Software is used for working with specific tasks and completing certain functions. Some examples of an application are the calculator (for computing math), play store (for downloading content), Google (to search content), and many more like so. 
-Utility Software is an aide with different programs to help change or redirect a computer. An example of utility software would be McAfee or ESET. These are programs that make changes to a computer to shield it from viruses and all kinds of other gunk that may invade one’s pc.
-Operating system software is the parent of almost all programs. It is the initial program that gets inputted into a pc, which holds and controls many other different sub-programs and applications, as well as, control major functions and files. Some examples include Windows Operating systems, Apple Mac OS, Android, etc. 

#### ERP
Mainly used for various sized business- from big corps to small businesses (nowadays). It is a tool that combines different files and data from various users into one compiled database. This is extremely helpful for organizations with their accounting matters- helps to keep and bring all profits made into one system. Example of an ERP would be SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft. 
#### Virtualization
The purpose of virtualization is to share the capabilities of a hard drive among servers. A common IT problem solved by virtualization is breaking up a server into smaller parts that control a function and better in handling tasks. Following this, hypervisor in virtualization is a distinguishment of resources between physical and virtual environments. 
#### Python
-Simple but impactful. Manages the memory by itself. A high-level language. Portable to diverse platforms. 
-Interpreted language: instructions are outputted directly. 
-Compiled language: instruction is taken into machine code, then the processor executes. 
-Python1
-Python2
#### Graphic Modeling and Rendering
#### File Compression
#### Artificial Intelligence

### Career Exploration
#### Bureau of Labor Statistics
-Web Developers and Digital Designers
-2020 median pay: 77,200/year ; 37.12/hour
-entry level education: bachelor’s degree
-# of jobs (2020): 199,400
-job outlook (2020-’30): 13%
-employment change (2020-’30): 25,500
#### Handshake
It is a very useful resource. In my experience, I found it to be utilized easily. There are many support links one can go to for help. And it does an amazing job at enhancing one’s career readiness. 
#### Certifications, Certificates, and Degrees
-CompTIA: finds, shields and executes cybersecurity.
-Cisco: Associate level: CCNA Enterprise, CyberOps Associate, DevNet Associate
-CISSP: Focused on cybersecurity. Positions include: IT Director, security analyst, network architect, etc.
A Tri-c program/certificate of interest to me would have to be software development. 
#### Industry Associations and Student Organizations
-ACM-W: the purpose of this organization is to empower and bring more awareness to women in the technology field. Benefits would include increase in pay, higher establishment, more recognition, etc. 
### Computer Architecture
#### CPU
-CPU's role is "the brain of the computer." It processes data through various steps to get to a final instruction or solution. The interaction of ALU with CPU helps the CPU to choose between which instructions to complete depending on the output.
-In a grocery store you have an input of a barcode. You scan the barcode, the data is processed by the CPU, to which it then outputs the description and price of the product on the screen. 
#### Gates and Circuits
A truth table is an output for every possible input. AND truth tables are outputs with strict inputs versus OR truth tables are any inputs producing outputs. 
#### IEEE
The purpose of IEEE is to advance technology to better the humanity. Their focus on ethics are very profound. They value ethics for the safety of the public, protection of their clients and customers, and the excellence and improvement of skills in their company and among their team.
#### Storage
-Latency: “average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head, after a completed seek.” The time it takes for the hard drive to read or write data.
-Transfer rates: the speed data is being transferred at. And it is “a function of the recording frequency.”
-SSD is newer, faster at processing data, is in the form of a chip, easy accessible data, and lightweight. Whereas the Hard drive disk is older, slower at processing data, physical form of a needle and disk, takes awhile to startup data, and is heavier. 

#### Memory
-Increasing RAM impacts computing speed because more data can be put in into the faster RAM without touching the slower hard drive. 
Two differences between RAM and hard disk storage are one, the RAM is temporary storage for when the CPU needs to retrieve data on the spot versus hard disk storage is permanent where files and specific operating system data is stored. Two, RAM works at a faster rate than the hard disk storage.

#### Data Representation
-Decimal represents numbers with 10 digits. Binary represents numbers with 2 digits. And hexadecimal represents numbers with 10 digits and 6 characters. 
-Representation of #ab0fff: vivid violet. 11210751 (decimal value). This color would be problematic because of the many variants of such a color and the many similar hues it has with other alike colors. The trend of the color, the rate of variants of a color, the vibrancy of a color- should all be considered. 
-The binary for decimal 198 is 11000110. 128 can go into 198 so subtract. We get 70, 64 can go into 70, so subtract. We get 6, 4 can go into 6 so subtract. We get 2, 2 can go into 2, subtract. We get zero, zero cannot go into 1, so we stop. 
-The decimal for binary 10001101 is 141. The numbers that can go into the decimal are found by the ones. We look at the numbers placed as ones, add them, and get our decimal answer.
