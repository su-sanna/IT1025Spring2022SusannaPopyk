## Executive Summary
To be completed in the last module of the semester.

### Information System Components
-Hardware: PCs and/or phones are used by Amazon to make products accessible for purchase to clients. On the consumer side, PCs and/or phones are used to access the Amazon site and its products.
-Software: With the application software, Amazon is able to create its app and website where it can  upload files that hold information on their products; display their goods and services. On the consumer side, it allows customers to purchase goods.
-Data: Amazon can formulate analyses from data of purchases, wish lists, etc., to enhance their software, improve in various areas from products to customer services. 
-People: People is what keeps Amazon standing and succeeding. Without consumers, clients, and customers, Amazon would not be where it is today. The people invest in Amazon, purchase daily goods from it, and influence its advertisements. Not only do people benefit Amazon, but Amazon benefits the people too by providing them with jobs. And versatile jobs at that- from warehouse to delivery and beyond. 
-Process: Amazon is successful because their goal, I would say, is customer satisfaction. They make sure order details are correct, send various confirming emails, send out package tracking, and try their hardest to deliver quickly and efficiently. Thus, this whole process of purchasing from Amazon to retrieving the goods is to be done meticulously for the customer satisfaction. 

### Software
#### GitHub
Hadn’t had a full lot experience with Github, but overall, I like it and it looks straightforward. Github’s cloud computing is organized, easily understandable, and accessible. Github is very useful and fair in regards to the client-server. It is simple and broken down for the client to understand and be able to work at his own pace. Github gives a lot of resources, tools, and helps for all kinds of projects and for various instances. It also allows multiple people with various levels of knowledge and different backgrounds to be able to explore their site.

#### Screen Capture
The file I uploaded to GitHub is named, "ScreenCapture." It was created through the snipping tool found in Windows Operating System distributed by Microsoft. The type of file it is, is a PNG. It opens with "photos." Has the size of 68.8 KB or 70.538 bytes.
#### Application, Utility, and Operating Systems
-Application Software is used for working with specific tasks and completing certain functions. Some examples of an application are the calculator (for computing math), play store (for downloading content), Google (to search content), and many more like so. 
-Utility Software is an aide with different programs to help change or redirect a computer. An example of utility software would be McAfee or ESET. These are programs that make changes to a computer to shield it from viruses and all kinds of other gunk that may invade one’s pc.
-Operating system software is the parent of almost all programs. It is the initial program that gets inputted into a pc, which holds and controls many other different sub-programs and applications, as well as, control major functions and files. Some examples include Windows Operating systems, Apple Mac OS, Android, etc. 

#### ERP
Mainly used for various sized business- from big corps to small businesses (nowadays). It is a tool that combines different files and data from various users into one compiled database. This is extremely helpful for organizations with their accounting matters- helps to keep and bring all profits made into one system. Example of an ERP would be SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft. 
#### Virtualization
The purpose of virtualization is to share the capabilities of a hard drive among servers. A common IT problem solved by virtualization is breaking up a server into smaller parts that control a function and better in handling tasks. Following this, hypervisor in virtualization is a distinguishment of resources between physical and virtual environments. 
#### Python
-Simple but impactful. Manages the memory by itself. A high-level language. Portable to diverse platforms. 
-Interpreted language: instructions are outputted directly. 
-Compiled language: instruction is taken into machine code, then the processor executes. 
-Python1
-Python2
#### Graphic Modeling and Rendering
-Raster image: an image made up of tiny tiny pixels. This is why small images have poor quality. Raster image would be appropriate to use in gif or jpeg files; in photoshop or painting programs. 
-Vector image: not pixel based. Image made up with special geometry. These images do not loose quality when fluctuating the size of the images. Vector image would be appropriate to use in svg or pdf;  in advertising and marketing.
-For web developers, lossless image format is important because original data of a file is not lost, so if one needed reference or any original components of an image than it will be there. The lossy compression is important for web developers because it helps to decrease repetitive data, so the developer doesn’t waste time on de-clutting and can get straight to his task to be done. 
-Similarities of jpg, gif, and png files: png and gif support 8-bit colors, png and jpg support 24-bit colors. All are non-lossy. 
-Differences of jpg, gif, and png files: difference in tasks used for. Jpg used in natural scenes where color and intensity is smooth. Gif used in animations. Png used in logos and text/object images with sharp contrasts.
#### File Compression
The purpose and use of file compression is to combine multiple files into one. The difference in size that I observed between the original and compressed is a difference of 36KB. I would expect the differential as a JPEG file to be less because some data and quality of the image would be lost and/or decreased in the compression process. 
#### Artificial Intelligence

#### Handshake
It is a very useful resource. In my experience, I found it to be utilized easily. There are many support links one can go to for help. And it does an amazing job at enhancing one’s career readiness. 
#### Certifications, Certificates, and Degrees
-CompTIA: finds, shields and executes cybersecurity.
-Cisco: Associate level: CCNA Enterprise, CyberOps Associate, DevNet Associate
-CISSP: Focused on cybersecurity. Positions include: IT Director, security analyst, network architect, etc.
A Tri-c program/certificate of interest to me would have to be software development. 
#### Industry Associations and Student Organizations
-ACM-W: the purpose of this organization is to empower and bring more awareness to women in the technology field. Benefits would include increase in pay, higher establishment, more recognition, etc. 
### Computer Architecture
#### CPU
-CPU's role is "the brain of the computer." It processes data through various steps to get to a final instruction or solution. The interaction of ALU with CPU helps the CPU to choose between which instructions to complete depending on the output.
-In a grocery store you have an input of a barcode. You scan the barcode, the data is processed by the CPU, to which it then outputs the description and price of the product on the screen. 
#### Gates and Circuits
A truth table is an output for every possible input. AND truth tables are outputs with strict inputs versus OR truth tables are any inputs producing outputs. 
#### IEEE
The purpose of IEEE is to advance technology to better the humanity. Their focus on ethics are very profound. They value ethics for the safety of the public, protection of their clients and customers, and the excellence and improvement of skills in their company and among their team.
#### Storage
-Latency: “average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head, after a completed seek.” The time it takes for the hard drive to read or write data.
-Transfer rates: the speed data is being transferred at. And it is “a function of the recording frequency.”
-SSD is newer, faster at processing data, is in the form of a chip, easy accessible data, and lightweight. Whereas the Hard drive disk is older, slower at processing data, physical form of a needle and disk, takes awhile to startup data, and is heavier. 

#### Memory
-Increasing RAM impacts computing speed because more data can be put in into the faster RAM without touching the slower hard drive. 
Two differences between RAM and hard disk storage are one, the RAM is temporary storage for when the CPU needs to retrieve data on the spot versus hard disk storage is permanent where files and specific operating system data is stored. Two, RAM works at a faster rate than the hard disk storage.

#### Data Representation
-Decimal represents numbers with 10 digits. Binary represents numbers with 2 digits. And hexadecimal represents numbers with 10 digits and 6 characters. 
-Representation of #ab0fff: vivid violet. 11210751 (decimal value). This color would be problematic because of the many variants of such a color and the many similar hues it has with other alike colors. The trend of the color, the rate of variants of a color, the vibrancy of a color- should all be considered. 
-The binary for decimal 198 is 11000110. 128 can go into 198 so subtract. We get 70, 64 can go into 70, so subtract. We get 6, 4 can go into 6 so subtract. We get 2, 2 can go into 2, subtract. We get zero, zero cannot go into 1, so we stop. 
-The decimal for binary 10001101 is 141. The numbers that can go into the decimal are found by the ones. We look at the numbers placed as ones, add them, and get our decimal answer. 
#### Operating Systems
I went to the search bar and typed in cmd. Popped up "Command Prompt," I clicked on "open" under it and opened up the command line window. After the initial text that is there, I typed in "mkdir (space) IT1025." There I indicated I made a space between "mkdir" and "IT1025." After this command I hit enter. Then I went into "File Explorer", then User, then my account in the pc, and there I found the file for "IT1025." Lastly, I took a screencapture of my file and uploaded it to Github as "IT1025Folder."
### Networking
### Network Design
My design is a data transfer between two computers and a printer. There is a route in the center that connects all the devices in the one network together. Then, to it are connected the two computers. The router catches the signal that the computers want to print a certain page, then it relays that info to the printer. Finally, the printer outputs the results. 
#### Data Transmission
Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate.
Packet: Unit of data.
IP Address: Unique identifying number.
Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address.
DNS: Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com.
The data transmission process begins with a host (any communicational device), which follows a protocol to communicate to another device once a packet has been established. An IP address is established. Then, the packet-switching works with the DNS to choose the IP address needed to base the destination of data being transmitted to. 
#### Hardware
The switch has the greater benefit versus the hub because it works more efficiently at transmitting data. In a scenario where an IP address is not found, the switch will transmit the data to all devices in the network instead of one specific destination. Routers are more beneficial than hubs and switches because of its attentiveness. The router is able to send data to multitude of various destinations and networks at a greater speed versus hubs and switches that only send to one device. 
#### Topologies and Types of Networks
Single point of failure is a flaw in a portion of a system that can cause the system to fail as a whole. The type of topologies that experience this issue are bus topologies, because if one cable fails then all the rest of the cables fail, resulting in the network to crash. Infrastructure and Wireless mesh topology are similar in that they both have multiple access points. The only difference is that one is physically connected to the switch, while the other is wirelessly connected to the switch. I think the wireless is better because it saves you money and time spent on the extra cabling, and with the wireless, if there was a fail in a connection it won’t crash all other connections; the rest of the connections would still work. 
#### Protocols
Primary actions of protocols: Communication, Network management, Security.
-Communication: various network devices can transfer data among each other. An example of this is Bluetooth headphones- they work according to Bluetooth protocols to connect the headphones to another device such as a computer or phone. 
-Network management: makes sure devices on a single network run properly. An example of this is when a computer is lagging or crashing, one can try to run troubleshooting protocols to reset the computer and check errors occurring. 
-Security: takes precaution to keep information on a device safe from strangers. An example of this is encryption. Encryption follows a protocol to secure data during transfer by asking for a security code or some form of pin or password. 
HTTP stands for “hypertext transfer protocol.” It is a protocol that transfers data throughout the web. It is an example of client-server model because it is the server that runs the web software on the client which can be a computer, phone, or tablet. 
The protocols used by secure HTTP to protect data are encryption protocols. One of which is called Transport Layer Security (TLS). This cryptographic protocol that uses authenticated connections to securely transfer data over the internet through http. 

##### IP Address
An IP address is a number that allows different devices in a network to communicate with each other. IPv4 is a smaller address size than IPv6. IPv4 is a 32-bit address, while IPv6 is 128-bit hexadecimal address. Alongside being the larger sized address, IPv6 is better in that, that it’s much simpler, and processes packets and performance faster and efficiently, and is more secure than IPv4. 
##### ICANN
ICANN stands for Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. This is a non-profit partnership of people from various locations around the globe. Their goal is to “ensure a secure, unified internet globally.” They develop different policies for the internet. 
### Cybersecurity and Encryption
#### Security Triad
The security triad component of confidentiality impacts the approach of online medical records such as MyChart by integrating cybersecurity software to help maintain patients’ information private and safe from hackers and threats. The security triad component of integrity impacts the approach of online medical records such as MyChart by upholding to HIPPA standards and protocols to ensure the data of a patient being inputted or transmitted into MyChart is not changed or edited. The security triad component of availability impacts the approach of online medical records such as MyChart by maintaining the systems and devices that have access to MyChart working properly; without error. And this component makes sure to have saved files and restoration available in case some data were to get lost. 
#### Caesar and Polyalphabetic Ciphers
The difference between Caesar and Polyalphabetic ciphers is that the Caesar cipher shifts each letter by an agreed number of spaces, while the polyalphabetic cipher substitutes letters multiple times. An example of an encryption of the statement, “Tri-c has a cybersecurity certificate,” as a Caesar cipher would be the following: “pney dwo w yuxanoayqnepu yanpebeywpa.” 
#### Public and Private Key Encryption
A public key encrypts a message while the private key decrypts it. And a public key is matched to one private key. 
#### Brute-Force Attacks
The several methods that can be used to help prevent brute force attacks are as such: creating more longer passwords and more weird and out of the box passwords, using secure browsers and/or utilizing other tools that have a secure function such as antivirus applications having a function of browsing the web securely. And lastly, for various account creation and web recreation, to use two-way authentications, making the info less easily accessible to outsiders. 
### Internet Programming
#### Components of a URL
-Scheme: https
-Domain: www.amazon.com 
-Top level domain: .edu
-Default page: result of search
-Parameters: no file path provided
-Anchor: specific location on a page

#### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is the founder of the World Wide Web, established in 1989. He created W3C to refine the standard of the Web. The “Web Designs and Applications” standard is important because it considers people with disabilities - it enhances content to be accessible to the disabled. It works on delivering more secure privacy, and building or enhancing a more efficient site. 
### Software Development
#### Algorithms
-Variable: “box in the computer’s memory.” Result of an expression can be saved in this box, and the box later, can substitute for the long expression. Example in my code = my age or name (instead of writing out my name or age, the box was created to input it automatically). Author uses such variable names as spam, bacon, and eggs because of a reference to a comedy sketch. 
-Assignment statement: a variable name equaling an output. Example in my code = “my Age” held the value of 21. 
-Function: code that implements a certain task. Example in my code = “print,” which tells the program to run whatever code you input. 
-Data types = category of values. 3 types:
-Integers: whole numbers. Example used in my code = my age ( 21 ). 
-Floating-point numbers: numbers with decimals. No example used in my code.
-Strings: texts. Example used in my code = “Hello World,” “It is good to meet you,” etc.
